# XMRig (enWILLYado version)
[XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig) is a team that has some high performance Monero (XMR) miners, with official support for Windows.
This fork is originally based on the [CPU-mining](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) version with some optimizations/rewrites, interesting features for final users and a little code refactors.

* This software is like the [CPU-mining](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) version; but there is also a [NVIDIA GPU version](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-nvidia) and [AMD GPU version]( https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig-amd).
* [Roadmap](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/issues/106) for next releases.

## Own features

* Connect to pool or proxies over HTTP PROXY.
